        Extract structured information about the company "${companyName}" from the following search results:
        
        ${formattedResults}
        
        Your task is to identify and extract:
        
        1. Entities (with unique IDs):
           - Company: The main company and any subsidiaries or parent companies
           - Person: Key executives, founders, or other important people
           - Product: Products or services offered by the company
           - Location: Headquarters, offices, or other important locations
           - Event: Important events in the company's history
           - Other: Any other relevant entities
        
        2. Relationships between entities:
           - employs: Company employs Person
           - subsidiary_of: Company is a subsidiary of another Company
           - founded_by: Company was founded by Person
           - offers: Company offers Product
           - located_in: Company is located in Location
           - competitor_of: Company is a competitor of another Company
           - other relevant relationships
        
        Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
        {
          "entities": [
            {
              "id": "unique_id",
              "name": "Entity name",
              "type": "Entity type (Company, Person, Product, Location, Event, Other)",
              "description": "Brief description",
              "url": "URL if available",
              "properties": { additional properties if any }
            },

            },
            ...
          ]
        }
        
        Ensure that:
        1. Each entity has a unique ID (e.g., "company-1", "person-2")
        2. Relationships reference entities by their IDs
        3. You only extract information that is supported by the search results
        4. You deduplicate entities and relationships
